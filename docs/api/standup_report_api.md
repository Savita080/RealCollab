# Daily Standup Report API Reference

This API reference covers the Standup Report Generator, an AI-powered service for RealCollab that creates personalised daily standups based on a user's workspace role (admin vs contributor).

**Architecture:**
This service is a **PURE COMPUTE LAYER**. The Node.js backend queries MongoDB, assembles the `StandupRequest` payload, and POSTs it here.

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:8003` *(configurable via env vars)*
